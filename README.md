# waste-classification


Instantiates my Jetson Nano project, a camera classification tool


This work depends on the UI tools created as part of the Jetson Hello AI World Tutorial
found at https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference.


To get started here, you will need to clone this repo, along with jetson-inference, to the same repo level.


git clone X

git clone X

cd waste-classification

docker/setup.sh



And you can either download the model from HERE,

or train your own with the adapted commands

python3 train.py ...
